## BNS Blacklist Record
Player Name: Galgadots    
Incident Time: 04/05/2019 12:00:00    
Record Code: I001     
Reason:  
Does not know ST mech at all, killed the entire party twice because he didn't know anything about conduction so he went far and solo conducted and died and left everyone in ss not being able to CC then the party almost wiped (caused some ppl to use rez charm including me that was on my alt). 2nd phase same thing failed conduction and died by himself after we addressed him the first time and then caused the party to wipe (Couldn't tell at that point if he wiped us on purpose or not because I saw him went farther to get solo conducted and died on purpose the second time). Doesn't apologize or speak up or anything. Don't even do DPS just wanting a free carry.
