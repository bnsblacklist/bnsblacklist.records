Record Code: B002     
Reason:  
@Swirlled#4542 DIscord ID: 363535616274595841 - Offense: Previously had posted that he was selling his HM 25 Destro w/ Aransu 9 KFM. The buyer had paid for the account and the transaction was complete. A few days later, the seller attempted to recover the account back. The buyer had contacted NCSoft and got the account temporarily banned but the scammer got a hold of the old owner and got the necessary information to unlock the account.   

The scammer had made claims that he attempted to recover the account AFTER the buyer had submitted a chargeback on paypal.   

After reviewing evidence, it was found that the scammer had tried to retrieve the account on SATURDAY 4/6/2019 @ 10:47 AM EST.   

It wasn't until SATURDAY 4/6/2019 @ 11:25 PM that the buyer had reported the scam. The scammer tried to submit picture evidence of the dispute but failed to realize that the email showed it was submitted on SUNDAY 4/7/2019 @ 3:04 AM (Roughly 17 hours AFTER the account was compromised)   

As it stands, the scammer holds both the account and the money and refuses to refund.
