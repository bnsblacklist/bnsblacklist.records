## Blade & Soul Blacklist Record
----
### What is this repo?
This repo is used to record all blacklisted players' information and proves of malicious behaviors.

### Important Information:
This is not the official ban list. This is just a community maintained blacklist. It is possible that people get wrongly blacklisted.  
If such thing happened, please submit an issue and we will contact you. If you want to add a player into blacklist, please also submit an issue.  

### How do I know if a player is blacklist?
First go into the region folder. Then you can search through the player list in the specific List.md. With unique id, you can go into the folder and find the proof. Or you can use the bnsblacklist program to check if a player is blacklisted.
